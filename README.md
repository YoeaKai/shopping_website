# Shopping_website

#### Shopping_website is a price comparison service that provides users with the cheapest product from different websites.

## About Projects

##### Shopping_website implements a gRPC server with Golang to establish a shopping website serving several users parallelized and streaming and equips:

* Plural workers crawl the product information using colly (framework for Golang) and the APIs opened by the target platform (like PChome) from different platforms concurrently.
* Database (MariaDB) establishes a cache mechanism.
* Structured logs make debugging more efficient.
* Interfaces increase scalability and achieve low coupling.
* Sleep time for rate limit avoids being mistaken for DDoS.
* Docker packages it to a container and I deployed it in AWS.
